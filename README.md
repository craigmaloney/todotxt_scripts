This is a collection of scripts to help make my life easier using todo.txt (available at [todotxt.com](http://todotxt.com))

* check_todotxt_health.sh: Put this in cron to show conflicted files, lines without context, and recurring tasks.
* upcoming.sh: Used with todo.sh view to show overdue tasks, upcoming tasks for the next two weeks, and prioritized tasks. (requires the schedule plugin)
* due: shows tasks that are due (requires the schedule plugin)
* scoreboard: used with a context to show what next actions remain in that context
